Strings are immutable in Java (the basic string class).
All classes declare comes from a class called Object. 
You can only have collection on objects, not primitive types.
Protected can be private but accessible to the child class.
When we using the word final, the class cannot be initiated. ‘final’ in Java is equal to ‘const’ in c++. Yu can use the final keyword on class, method or attribute. 
Interfaces are abstract class with different abstract classes.
